## ✅ Week 1 – Build Your First AI Agent
🎯 **Goal:**  
Set up a local LLM workflow and build a plugin-enabled AI assistant.

**What was done:**
- Installed and ran LLMs locally using Ollama  
- Integrated LangChain and Gradio to build an interactive UI  
- Built a plugin-capable agent that could call external tools:
  - Brave Search 🔍
  - Puppeteer for web scraping 📄
  - Filesystem tools 📁
  - Notion and GitHub APIs 🧠🐙  
- (Optional) Automatically scraped and saved data to Notion

## ✅ Week 2 – Data Collection & Cleaning Pipeline
🎯 **Goal:**  
Create a reproducible pipeline for collecting and cleaning multimodal data (text, audio, image).

**What was done:**
- Performed web scraping (text & PNG) and audio crawling (.mp3)  
- Applied content extraction, language filtering, and standardization  
- Used MinHash + datasketch to detect and remove duplicates  
- Saved final clean dataset in JSONL format  
- All steps implemented as modular Jupyter Notebooks

## ✅ Week 3 – Build a Local Voice-Based AI Assistant
🎯 **Goal:**  
Create a modular voice-based AI assistant that processes voice input and generates spoken responses using local models.

**What was done:**
- Built an ASR → LLM → TTS pipeline served via FastAPI  
- Used Faster-Whisper or Whisper.cpp to transcribe speech  
- Queried local LLaMA3 model via Ollama for responses  
- Converted output text to speech via Edge-TTS  
- Added multi-turn memory to maintain conversational context  
- Exposed via `/voice-chat/` API endpoint  
- (Optional) Dockerized the entire project for deployment

## ✅ Week 4 – Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with arXiv Papers
🎯 **Goal:**  
Build a foundational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored to scientific research.  

**What was done:**
- Collected 50 recent arXiv cs.CL PDF papers (via scraping or sample set)  
- Extracted and cleaned text from PDFs using PyMuPDF  
- Chunked documents into ≤512-token overlapping segments (sliding window)  
- Generated dense vector embeddings with Sentence-Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)  
- Built a FAISS index (IndexFlatL2) for fast vector similarity search  
- Developed a notebook demo for querying the index and displaying top text chunks  
- Exposed a `/search` FastAPI endpoint to accept queries and return top passages in JSON

## ✅ Week 5 – Advanced RAG with Hybrid Retrieval
🎯 **Goal:**  
Extend the RAG system with hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse methods) and design an evaluation pipeline for retrieval quality.  

**What was done:**
- Integrated **BM25** retriever with FAISS dense retriever → hybrid retrieval strategy  
- Implemented weighted scoring and rank fusion to combine dense + sparse results  
- Added evaluation using:
  - Recall@K, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), nDCG  
  - Human-in-the-loop spot checks for relevance  
- Enhanced pipeline modularity (retriever registry, configurable backends)  
- Built an interactive notebook for side-by-side retrieval comparison  
- Extended FastAPI service with `/hybrid-search` endpoint

✅ Week 6 – Voice Agent with Function Calling (Local Deployment)

🎯 Goal:
Build a fully local voice assistant that supports speech input/output and function calling.

What was done:

Implemented text + audio input via Streamlit frontend

Offline speech-to-text (STT) with faster-whisper

Added function calling support:

calculate(expression) → math calculation

search_arxiv(query) → simulated arXiv paper search

Integrated text-to-speech (TTS) using pyttsx3

Displayed multi-turn chat history in UI

Local deployment:

FastAPI backend (/docs for API testing)

Streamlit frontend (/voice for interaction)

Extensible design → add new tools in backend.py, swap STT/TTS for streaming

✅ Week 7 – LLM Fine-Tuning (LoRA & QLoRA)

🎯 Goal:
Perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models using LoRA and QLoRA.

What was done:

Set up fine-tuning pipeline with Hugging Face transformers + peft

Implemented LoRA adapters for efficient training on limited GPU resources

Used QLoRA with bitsandbytes for 4-bit quantization → reduced VRAM usage

Trained models on domain-specific datasets (instruction-style)

Evaluated fine-tuned models vs. base model on benchmark prompts

Saved and reloaded fine-tuned adapters for inference & deployment
